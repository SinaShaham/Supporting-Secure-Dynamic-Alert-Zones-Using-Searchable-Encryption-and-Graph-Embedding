# Supporting-Secure-Dynamic-Alert-Zones-Using-Searchable-Encryption-and-Graph-Embedding

Project: Supporting Secure Dynamic Alert Zones Using Searchable Encryption and Graph Embedding
Description: This study addresses privacy concerns in location-based alerts by using Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE) and proposes a graph embedding technique to enhance performance. The researchers introduce three heuristics that significantly improve computational overhead compared to existing methods. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
